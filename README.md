# Canvasgram

[CSSgram](https://github.com/una/CSSgram) can't save images with filter so I created this with HTML5 Canvas. So, I call this as Canvasgram!

##Usage

 1. Go to [this URL](https://setkyar.github.io/canvasgram/)
 2. Upload your image & download

#Which staff am I using?

 - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
